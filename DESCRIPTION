Description: This package gives a number of functions to aid common data analysis processes and reporting
    statistical results in an RMarkdown file. Data analysis functions combine multiple base R functions used to describe simple bivariate relationships into a single, easy to use function. Reporting functions will return character 
    strings to report p-values, confidence intervals, and hypothesis test and 
    regression results. Strings will be LaTeX-formatted as necessary and will
    knit pretty in an RMarkdown document. The package also provides a wrapper
    for the CreateTableOne function in the tableone package to make the results
    knitable.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.1)
