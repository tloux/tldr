Description: This package gives a number of functions to aid common data 
    analysis processes and reporting statistical results in an RMarkdown file. 
    Data analysis functions combine multiple base R functions used to describe 
    simple bivariate relationships into a single, easy to use function. 
    Reporting functions will return character strings to report p-values, 
    confidence intervals, and hypothesis test and regression results. Strings 
    will be LaTeX-formatted as necessary and will knit pretty in an RMarkdown 
    document. The package also provides a wrapper for the CreateTableOne 
    function in the tableone package to make the results knitable.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.1)
Imports:
    tableone, 
    ggplot2
Suggests:
    knitr
